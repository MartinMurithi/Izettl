// Financial Inclusion Gap:

// Provide Statistics:
// "The global financial inclusion gap remains a significant challenge, with millions of individuals and businesses lacking access to formal financial services. According to recent data, over 1.7 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, with the majority residing in developing countries. In regions such as Africa, the financial inclusion gap is particularly pronounced, with only a small percentage of the population having access to basic financial services. These statistics highlight the urgent need for solutions to address this gap and empower underserved populations."
